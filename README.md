<h1>Onboarding Frontend</h1>
Onboarding is a web application that organises activities and tasks for new employees as part of their onboarding process. This repository is the front end.

<h2>Purpose</h2>
Current onboarding processes for new employees were done on paper. This presents a problem with portability and storage. A web application was proposed to facilitate this, plus enable collaboration and customisation across offices in different states.

<h3>Application Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>User authentication using Google accounts</li>
<li>An custom onboarding template for each state office</li>
<li>Administrators have authority to:
  <ul>
  <li>create a new task and assign an instructor to the task</li>
  <li>edit an existing task</li>
  <li>edit template tasks and their order</li>
  </ul>
<li>Managers can assign a template to a new subordinate and also an onboarding buddy</li>
<li>The new employee has access to their assigned tasks</li>
<li>Instructors and employee are able to mark a task as complete</li>
</ul>
